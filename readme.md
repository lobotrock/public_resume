## Experience
### Earnin 
Machine Learning Engineer July 2019 - Present  
Senior Software Developer Nov 2018 – July 2019  
Member of the Core-Product team which is responsible for improving and maintaining the overall experience of the Earnin
App.  In July of 2019, I joined the Data Science team as a Machine Learning Engineer to aid Data Scientists in deploying and scaling predictive modeling.


* Deploying, scaling, and tuning services and jobs in Kubernetes.
   - Attended training for best practices which I helped impliment at Earnin for the Data Science department.
* Served as mentor and presenter to discuss best coding and testing practices for both developers and data scientists.
* Create and maintain ASP .Net back end services which handle various methods of hours worked by Earnin user.
* Advance the use of microservices and virtualization:
  - Augment the current process for producing microservices to make the process easier to understand and more scalable by
automating more of the process setup with Yeoman scripts.
  - Virtualize the process of creating the microservice by running the scripts within a docker image, making it possible to
run the script on any platform.
* Aid data science team with optimizing Elasticsearch indexing and querying, and automating frequent searches to allow data
science team to move faster.



### Kroger Digital 
Senior Java Developer June 2017 – Oct 2018  
Member of the Digital Search team which is responsible for updating and maintaining the search microservices backing
Kroger’s Digital Product Search.


* Develop and maintain Java and Kotlin SpringBoot microservices which back Kroger’s product, coupon, and recipe search
using Agile Development Methodology.
* Advance data driven approaches for solving issues for product search:
  - Identify poor searches by analyzing customer behavior querying Hadoop and Elasticsearch databases.
  - Verify improvements made to the search algorithm by monitoring customer behavior data.
  - Update the search service to record customer facing data, which aides in debugging as well as enabling opportunities for
machine learning to further improve Kroger’s product search.
  - Generate reports for product owners and other stakeholders using historical data from Hadoop and various Python
libraries, such as Pandas, FB Prophet, and Pandas Profiler.
  - Create Web Application using Python with Flask to visualize data in real time.
* Design and create A/B testing platform for digital search:
  - Create a microservice using Rapidoid which functions as a reverse proxy to route traffic to the appropriate algorithm.
  - Create a proof of concept project which reads from real time customer behavior, and feeds that data back into the traffic
routing to enable multi-armed bandit testing.
+ Investigate and create a proof of concept for migrating our product search from Datastax to Elasticsearch:
  - Create data loader which writes thousands of rows per second to populate an Elasticsearch cluster with Kroger product
information.
  - Create a microservice which handles search requests for product with custom filters and sorting.
  - Develop scripts to automate the creation of an Elasticsearch cluster using docker images and multiple hosts.
+ Create a web application to facilitate an internal Kaggle-like data challenge, which allows users to register accounts, login,
score submitted answers and display a real time score board.
+ Contibute to automated testing suite which allows for continuous integration and automatic deployments with GitlabCI.
+ Develop and maintain Java SpringBoot applications responsible for consuming Apache Kafka queues, validating, loading
and indexing the data to Datastax (Cassandra and Solr) for millions of records daily.
+ Create visualizations and dashboards in Kibana that report realtime data to isolate and troubleshoot issues as they occur.
+ Teach and aid junior developers with pair programming to ensure best coding practices.
+ Provide 24 hour on call support for search team services that are critical to Kroger’s online experience.


### Digital Media Group, Inc. 
IT Systems Programmer Analyst May 2013 – June 2017

required for the process.
+ Collect and clarify requirements from clients, and develop systems that meet those requirements.
+ Scrape external websites using Java to collect and store metadata in a searchable web application, which allowed staff to
communicate better with clients and troubleshoot issues.
+ Teach and advise non-coders C# in the development of Unity game projects.

### Ohio National Financial Services
